# ccy_converter
Very simple python ccy converter using the terminal

The program was completed to have some practice using json files and caching results.
The user inputs the ccy they would like to convert, the ccy they want to exchange into and the amount of ccy they are holding.

The program uses the following url for the rates:  http://www.floatrates.com/
